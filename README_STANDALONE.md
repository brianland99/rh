# Fusion Simple Search

Twigkit makes building rich search-based applications quicker and easier than ever before. This template was built on top of a Fusion search index but can be adapted for any Twigkit supported data source. 

## License

The application comes with a 30-day license key in `twigkit.lic`. Once this expires, you can download a new license key by visiting https://dev.twigkit.net/settings/keys/.
If you already have a license then remove this key before running the application.

## Basic configuration

Before you can start up the application, a couple of configurations need to be made.

Firstly, edit `config/platforms/fusion/fusion.conf` to specify which Fusion collection and pipeline to use:

```
host: YOUR_HOST
collection: YOUR_COLLECTION
pipeline: YOUR_QUERY_PIPELINE
```

Secondly, you need to edit `config/security/fusion.conf` and specify the URL of your Fusion authentication endpoint:

```
# Specify which Fusion security realm to use
realm-name: native
timeout: 28799
```

Lastly, the API service is leveraged for all communication with Fusion:

`services/api/fusion.conf`

But can be overridden by platform configurations.

## Signals Configuration
As of Appkit 4.0.0 you need to configure services to integrate with the Fusion Signals API as per the release notes:
[Release Notes Appkit 4.0.0](https://dev.twigkit.net/docs/Release_notes/4.0.0/)

There are two new locations under `config/`:

`message/service/fusion.conf`

and

`activity/tracking/tracker.conf`

## Running the application

Once started, the application is served up at http://localhost:8080. You will be asked to authenticate, for which you can use any of your Fusion "native realm" users, or the realm you configured in `config/security/fusion/fusion.conf` above.

### Mac OS X, Linux

In the terminal simply do:

`sh app-start`

### Windows

At the command line run:

`app-start.bat`

### Running the app over SSL

The webapp can also be served over HTTPS using SSL encryption. This is done using the following parameters when invoking the startup scripts:

- `-Dtwigkit.ssl=true` required to turn on secure mode

We include a keystore file with a default self-signed key for development / testing of secure mode. However in order to establish proper trust you will need to import your own valid SSL certificate into the file `keystore.jks` or create your own keystore file. You can then configure SSL via:

- `-Dtwigkit.https.port` optionally sets the port (defaults to 8765)
- `-Dtwigkit.keystore.file` keystore filename / location relative to webapp (defaults to 'keystore.jks')
- `-Dtwigkit.keystore.password` password to the keystore (defaults to 'p4ssw0rd')
- `-Dtwigkit.keystore.alias` name of the key in the keystore to be used (defaults to 'default-key')

## Key files and folders

The application is made up of a handful of files and folders.

### `/app/views`

This is generally where the magic happens. The views are created with our flexible markup which makes it easy to describe even complex user interaction. Each view is automatically given a pretty URL and within it you use our tags to connect to a data provider, choose what to show and how. In this application, `search.html` is the main search page. Additional pages can be created as needed.

### `/config`

Twigkit uses configuration files to define endpoints for obtaining data (data providers, data processors and other middleware type operations. This allows you centrally manage these things ensuring that not too much of this ends up in the view layer.

### `/app/styles`

Your application comes with a sample theme. You can easily remove the style settings and set your own such as colours, fonts, and layout. Put any custom styling into `includes/custom.less`.

### `/app/scripts`

In this folder you will find a few JavaScript files responsible for conducting the orchestra. These will just do their thing, so you will generally know if you need to work with them, e.g. define your own controllers etc.

### `/app/assets`

This folder contains supporting downloadable assets like images.


## A typical page

Twigkit offers an array of custom elements or tags that handle all the complexities of connecting to a data provider like Fusion and visualising the data that comes back. Each widget will automatically know how to show the data and request new data based on user interaction.

In this section we will walk you through all the tags that make up a typical page like the one you will find in `app/views/search.html`.

### Connecting to a data provider

Twigkit handles all the nuances of efficiently communicating with a data provider like Fusion. It will adapt our standardised way of declaring user questions to something Fusion (or other providers) will understand, and map the response to a generic format our widgets can work with.

There are three components to a particular request/response. First, you define which provider to use, then create a query from the URL or any parameters you explicitly declare, and finally send the query to the platform and obtain a response.


Below you will see all the tags needed to declare a data provider, build a query, and obtain a response.

```
<search:platform var="platform" conf="platforms.fusion"></search:platform>
<search:query var="query" parameters="*"></search:query>
<search:response var="response" platform="platform" query="query"></search:response>
```

#### The Platform Tag

For every data provider there is a configuration file and an endpoint. The platform tag determines which endpoint is used to obtain data.

In this case we declare a data provider (platform) for a particular Fusion collection and set of parameters to search through an index.

```
<search:platform var="platform" conf="platforms.fusion"></search:platform>
```

#### The Query Tag

The Query tag constructs a Twigkit query object. You can choose to build a query from scratch by passing in the parameters you want or you can have it automatically created from the page URL.

Here's how you build a query using all query string parameters, and default to 12 results per page:

```
<search:query var="query" parameters='*' results-per-page="12"></search:query>
```

Conversely, if you didn't want the user to be able to specify results per page you would simply omit that parameter when building a query from the URL:

```
<search:query var="query" parameters='*,-rpp' results-per-page="12"></search:query>
```

#### The Response Tag

Finally the Response tag brings the two together, the Platform (or data provider) and the query.

In the example below we refer to the previously defined platform and query by variable name:

```
<search:response var="response" platform="platform" query="query"></search:response>
```

### Controlling page layout

Built into Twigkit are tags to determine the layout and structure of the page. Using these ensures that the application will work equally well on desktops, mobiles and other devices (like high-resolution screens).

Twigkit uses the generally accepted grid layout to control how large sections appear on the screen, and how they behave when the visible area or resolution changes.

A simple grid:

```
<layout:grid>
  <layout:block small="1-2" large="1-4">
    Narrow section on large screens.
  </layout:block>
  <layout:block small="1-2" large="3-4">
    Wide on large screens.
  </layout:block>
</layout:grid>
```
